# sbwpi

setup sbwdn along with dnsmasq, hostapd, etc. to turn your pi into a fan qiang router.

## How to use
run below command on pi as root
```
git clone https://github.com/sevenever/sbwpi
cd sbwpi
./sbwpi
reboot
```
Then connect your PC or phone to SSID "sbwdn" with password "qiongwanchefuwanbiao".

If your pi is connected to your home network with rj45 then you are done. Enjoy the freedom!

If your pi is connected to your home network with USB wifi(raspberry pi zero), open browser then go to http://sbwdn.net, select your home wifi SSID and input password, click "add", then click "apply" when you see that button.
